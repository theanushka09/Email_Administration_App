# Email_Administration_App
A simple Java application for IT administrators to create and manage new-hire email accounts. It generates standardized email addresses, assigns departments, creates random passwords, and allows basic mailbox/account configuration.

## Features
- Generates emails in the format: `firstname.lastname@department.company.com`
- Department selection: `sales`, `development`, `accounting` (or blank if none)
- Random password generation
- Setters to:
  - Change password
  - Set mailbox capacity
  - Set an alternate email address
- Getters to display:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Mailbox capacity

## Project Structure 
- `src/` – Java source files
  - `Email.java` – core email/account logic (generation + setters/getters)
  - `EmailApp.java` – main/driver class (user prompts + demo)

## How It Works
1. Enter a first name and last name.
2. Choose a department (or none).
3. The app generates:
   - Email address based on naming + department
   - A random password
4. Optionally update account settings using setter methods.

Java

int rand = (int)(Math.random() * passwordset.length());
What it does (in plain English)
It generates a random integer index from 0 (inclusive) up to passwordset.length() (exclusive)—typically to pick a random character from passwordset.

Breakdown, piece by piece
passwordset.length()
The number of characters available in passwordset.
Example: if passwordset = "abcXYZ", then length() is 6.

Math.random()
Returns a double in the range [0.0, 1.0):

can be 0.0
will never be 1.0
Math.random() * passwordset.length()
Scales that [0.0, 1.0) value to [0.0, length).
If length is 6, result is in [0.0, 6.0).

(int)(...) cast
Casting a positive double to int in Java truncates (drops the decimal part; effectively “floor” here).
So values become:

0.0 → 0
5.999... → 5
Final outcome
rand becomes one of: 0, 1, 2, ..., length-1
That’s exactly the valid index range for characters in passwordset.

Why the parentheses matter
The cast applies to the whole product: (int)(Math.random() * length).
If you wrote (int)Math.random() * length, then (int)Math.random() is always 0, so the result would always be 0.

Common pitfalls / considerations
If passwordset is empty (length() == 0), then Math.random() * 0 is 0.0, so rand becomes 0—but using it as an index will fail because there is no index 0.
For password/security use cases, Math.random() is not cryptographically secure. Prefer java.security.SecureRandom.
Email Application

Scenario: You are an IT Support Administrator Specialist and are charged with the task of creating email accounts for new hires.

Your application should do the following:

 Generate an email with the following syntax: firstname.lastname@department.company.com

 Determine the department (sales, development, accounting), if none leave blank

 Generate a random String for a password

 Have set methods to change the password, set the mailbox capacity, and define an alternate email address

 Have get methods to display the name, email, and mailbox capacity THIS IS MY JAVA PROJECT TO BE ADDED AS A REPO IN GITHUB CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE ME A SHORT DESCRIPTION AND A README FILE TYPES CONTENT

# Email Application (Java)

A simple Java application for IT administrators to create and manage new-hire email accounts. It generates standardized email addresses, assigns departments, creates random passwords, and allows basic mailbox/account configuration.

## Features
- Generates emails in the format: `firstname.lastname@department.company.com`
- Department selection: `sales`, `development`, `accounting` (or blank if none)
- Random password generation
- Setters to:
  - Change password
  - Set mailbox capacity
  - Set an alternate email address
- Getters to display:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Mailbox capacity

## Project Structure (suggested)
- `src/` – Java source files
  - `Email.java` – core email/account logic (generation + setters/getters)
  - `EmailApp.java` – main/driver class (user prompts + demo)
- `README.md` – project documentation

## How It Works
1. Enter a first name and last name.
2. Choose a department (or none).
3. The app generates:
   - Email address based on naming + department
   - A random password
4. Optionally update account settings using setter methods.

## Example Email Formats
- With department: `john.doe@sales.company.com`
- Without department: `john.doe@company.com` *(if implemented to omit the department segment)*

## Requirements
- Java 8+ (recommended)

## Run (example)
Compile and run using your IDE, or from the command line:
1. Compile your `src` files
2. Run the `EmailApp` main class

## Future Improvements
- Validate department input
- Stronger password rules / SecureRandom usage
- Unit tests (JUnit)
- Configurable company domain and departments
